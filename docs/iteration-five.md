## Iteration Five ##

1. Characters can damage non-character *things* (props).
    - Anything that has Health may be a target
    - These things cannot be Healed and they do not Deal Damage
    - These things do not belong to Factions; they are neutral
    - When reduced to 0 Health, things are *Destroyed*
    - As an example, you may create a Tree with 2000 Health
